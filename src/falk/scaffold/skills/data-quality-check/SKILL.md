# Data Quality Check Skill

Use this skill when you need to validate data before presenting it to users or when the user asks about data quality.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks "how good is this data?" or "any data quality issues?"
- Before exporting large result sets
- When results seem unexpected or anomalous
- As a follow-up after showing aggregates

## Instructions

1. Load this skill when data quality is relevant
2. Use available scripts or resources to run checks
3. Report findings (nulls, duplicates, outliers, consistency)

## Notes

- This is a placeholder skill. Add scripts in `scripts/` to implement actual checks.
- See <https://github.com/DougTrajano/pydantic-ai-skills> for skill structure.
