# Cursor MCP Configuration for falk

You can connect falk as an MCP server to access governed data queries.

## Setup

1. Start the falk MCP server in your project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/falk-project
   falk mcp
   ```

2. Add to Cursor's MCP configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "falk": {
         "command": "falk",
         "args": ["mcp"],
         "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/your/falk-project"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   If Cursor spawns falk with the wrong cwd (e.g. you see "semantic_models.yaml not found" in your home dir), use `--project-root` to force the project path:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "falk": {
         "command": "falk",
         "args": ["mcp", "--project-root", "C:\\path\\to\\your\\falk-project"],
         "cwd": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\falk-project"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Or set `FALK_PROJECT_ROOT` in your environment.

3. Restart Cursor to load the MCP server

## Available Tools

- `list_catalog` — List metrics and/or dimensions (entity_type: metric \| dimension \| both)
- `query_metric` — Query metrics with filtering and grouping
- `query_metric` — Query metrics (use compare_period for period comparison, include_share for % breakdown)
- `generate_chart` — Create visualizations
- Plus more...

## Example Queries

Ask Cursor natural questions about your data:

- "What metrics are available?"
- "Show revenue by region last month"
- "Why did sales increase this quarter?"
- "Compare this month vs last month for revenue"
- "What are the top 10 customers by revenue?"

All queries go through your semantic layer with governed metrics.
